This is an excellent, very detailed prompt! It's well-structured and covers almost everything a programming AI would need. The clarity on model selection, MCP principles, and Gradio UI is top-notch.

Here are a few minor additions and clarifications that could make it even more robust or align perfectly with edge cases an AI might encounter or a user might expect:

I. Core Logic & Robustness (Mainly in app.py)

Gradio State Management for conversation_history:

Current: conversation_history is a global variable. If deployed (e.g., on Spaces) and accessed by multiple users, they would share the same conversation history, leading to context leakage.

Suggestion: Modify the Gradio part to use gr.State for conversation_history to make it session-specific.

In app.py (conceptual change):

# Remove global conversation_history = []

# ... inside Gradio Blocks ...
with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    # ...
    chat_state = gr.State([]) # To store conversation_history per session
    # ...
    # Modify respond function signature and calls
    # def respond(user_input, chat_display_history, current_conversation_state):
    #     # ... use current_conversation_state ...
    #     # ... update current_conversation_state ...
    #     return chat_display_history, "", current_conversation_state

    # submit_btn.click(respond, [message, chatbox, chat_state], [chatbox, message, chat_state])
    # message.submit(respond, [message, chatbox, chat_state], [chatbox, message, chat_state])


And generate_response would need to accept conversation_history as an argument.

Local Model JSON Parsing Robustness:

Current: if assistant_output.startswith("{") and json.loads(assistant_output). Small local models often wrap JSON in other text (e.g., "Okay, here's the tool call: {...}").

Suggestion: Add a small section in app.py's local model path to attempt to extract JSON using a simple regex if startswith("{") fails, before giving up on a tool call.

In app.py (local model section):

# ... after getting assistant_output from local_pipeline ...
tool_call = None
# Try direct parse first
if assistant_output.strip().startswith("{") and assistant_output.strip().endswith("}"):
    try:
        tool_call = json.loads(assistant_output.strip())
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        pass # Will try regex next

if not tool_call: # If direct parse failed or wasn't attempted
    import re
    match = re.search(r"\{\s*\"tool\":.*?\}", assistant_output, re.DOTALL)
    if match:
        try:
            tool_call = json.loads(match.group(0))
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            tool_call = None # JSON found but malformed
# ... rest of tool handling logic ...

Error Handling for Tool Calls:

Current: If server.calculate(expr) raises an unexpected error (beyond the caught eval error), or if the tool name in JSON is unknown.

Suggestion: Add a try-except around the tool execution block in generate_response and provide a generic error message back to the model.

In app.py (generate_response, both OpenAI and local sections):

# ... inside the `if tool_call and "tool" in tool_call:` block
try:
    if tool_name == "calculate" and hasattr(server, "calculate"):
        expr = params.get("expression", "")
        tool_result = server.calculate(expr)
    else:
        tool_result = f"Error: Unknown tool '{tool_name}'."
except Exception as e:
    tool_result = f"Error executing tool '{tool_name}': {e}"
# ... then proceed to feed tool_result back to the model

Clearer Instructions for OPENAI_MODEL:

Current: OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo" # default OpenAI model to use (can adjust to "gpt-4" if available)

Suggestion: Just a minor clarification in the comment that "gpt-4" might incur higher costs.

In app.py:

OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Default. Can change to "gpt-4" or "gpt-4-turbo-preview" if API key has access (may be more expensive).

II. Requirements & Setup

Additional Dependency for T5 Models:

Current: transformers is listed.

Suggestion: Add sentencepiece to requirements.txt. T5 models often require it for tokenization, and while transformers might pull it in as a sub-dependency, explicitly listing it is safer.

sentencepiece     # Tokenizer often used with T5 models

Consider also adding accelerate for potentially better local model performance, especially on GPU, though it's not strictly necessary for flan-t5-small.

III. README Clarifications

Clarity on Running server.py:

Current README: "Before starting the chat app, launch the MCP tool server... Note: In this project, the chat application directly calls the tool function for simplicity, so running the server separately is optional." This is slightly contradictory for a beginner.

Suggestion: Rephrase in the README to state that python server.py is not needed for the app to function (due to direct import) but can be run to test the server independently or to simulate a fully decoupled setup.

In README.md (Running the Tool Server section):
"The server.py file defines our MCP tools. In this MVP, app.py imports and calls the tool functions directly for simplicity. Therefore, you do not need to run python server.py in a separate terminal for the chatbot to work.
However, you can run python server.py independently if you want to:

Test the tool server on its own.

See the FastMCP server startup messages.

Prepare for a more advanced setup where app.py might communicate with server.py over a network (e.g., JSON-RPC), which is the standard MCP approach."

System Prompt Access to Resource:

Current: The fun_fact resource is defined and mentioned in the system prompt, but there's no explicit mechanism or instruction for the AI to request or use it, nor for the application to provide it proactively beyond the initial system prompt.

For an MVP, this is fine as an illustration. If you wanted it to be more active, the system prompt could instruct the AI: "If the user asks for a fun fact, you can use the info://fun_fact resource. To do so, output: {\"resource_request\": \"info://fun_fact\"}." Then app.py would need to handle this resource_request similarly to tool_call. Given "beginner-friendly MVP," the current illustrative approach is likely sufficient. No change needed unless you want this complexity.

Summary of Key Suggested Changes to the Prompt:

app.py:

Implement Gradio session state for conversation_history.

Improve JSON extraction for local model tool calls (regex fallback).

Add try-except for tool execution and unknown tools.

Slightly more detailed comment for OPENAI_MODEL.

requirements.txt:

Add sentencepiece.

README.md:

Clarify that running server.py separately is not needed for the provided app.py to function.

These additions would make the generated code more robust, slightly more aligned with multi-user scenarios (via Gradio state), and the instructions even clearer. Your original prompt is already very strong, so these are mostly refinements!
